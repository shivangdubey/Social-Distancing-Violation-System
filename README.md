# Social-Distancing-Violation-System
Using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms and OpenCV, the project aims to detect social distancing violations in CCTV footage (Open Source Computer Vision Library). The YOLO algorithm is a cutting-edge object detection model capable of detecting and classifying objects in real time. The project entails teaching the YOLO algorithm how to detect human bodies and their distances from one another in a video frame. The video footage is then processed using OpenCV, which employs the YOLO model to detect social distancing violations. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the project could be very useful in monitoring and enforcing social distancing protocols in public places.
